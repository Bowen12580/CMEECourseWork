\section{Introduction}
This report examines historical temperature data to answer the question: is Florida warming? By analyzing the temperature trends in Key West, Florida, I conclude that there is an upward trend in temperatures over the 20th century.

\section{Methods}
I conducted a permutation analysis to calculate the correlation coefficient between time and temperature, accounting for the serial dependence in the time-series data. This method shuffles the temperature data points and recalculates the correlation coefficient 1000 times to create a distribution of correlation coefficients under the null hypothesis of no relationship between time and temperature.

\section{Conclusion}
The statistical analysis clearly indicates that Florida is experiencing a warming trend. The observed correlation coefficient significantly exceeds the distribution of coefficients under the null hypothesis, with a p-value less than 0.0001. This analysis confirms that the temperatures in Key West have risen significantly over the past century.
