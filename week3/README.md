## Overview

**Code** contains the scripts.

**Data** contains data needed to run those scripts.

**Results** is where the output from those scripts is sent to.

**Sandbox** is a miscellaneous directory containing experimental code and data.

## Versions

R: 4.3.2

Python: 3.10.12

## List of Scripts
**Here contain R_Chapter and R_Visualization_Chapter codes**

- `apply1.R`: Demonstrates the use of `apply` function on a matrix to calculate row and column means and variances.
- `apply2.R`: Implements a custom operation using `apply` on a matrix, demonstrating conditional logic within the applied function.
- `basic_io.R`: Illustrates basic input-output operations in R, including reading and writing CSV files and manipulating data frames.
- `boilerplate.R`: A template script in R with a defined function, showcasing function definition, argument handling, and output.
- `break.R`: Demonstrates the use of the `break` statement within a while loop to control loop execution.
- `browse.R`: Shows the use of `browser()` function in a loop for debugging and examining code execution step by step.
- `control_flow.R`: Contains examples of control flow constructs in R like if-else statements and for loops.
- `DataWrang.R`: Script for wrangling the Pound Hill dataset, including loading, inspecting, and manipulating the data.
- `DataWrangTidy.R`: Demonstrates data wrangling using the `tidyverse` package, with operations such as data transposition and modification.
- `Florida.R`: Analyzes the Key West Annual Mean Temperature dataset, including calculating correlation coefficients and performing a permutation test.
- `FloridaAutoCorr_writeup.pdf`: Include compiled content of group work.
- `FloridaAutoCorr_writeup.tex`: Contains latex code of group work
- `FloridaReport.pdf`: Include compiled content of practical question Florida
- `FloridaReport.tex`: Contains latex code of practical question Florida
- `get_TreeHeight.py`: A Python script to calculate tree height using trigonometry from angles and distance measurements in a CSV file.
- `get_TreeHeight.R`: An R script equivalent of the Python version for calculating tree height using trigonometry based on angle and distance.
- `Girko.R`: Demonstrates the Girkoâ€™s circular law through eigenvalue distribution of a random matrix, visualizing the result in a plot.
- `GPDD_Data.R`: Loads and maps the Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD) data, highlighting geographic distribution of data points.
- `MyBars.R`: Creates bar plots in R using `ggplot2` with data from a text file, including customization of plot elements.
- `next.R`: Utilizes the `next` statement in R within a loop to skip iterations under certain conditions.
- `plotLin.R`: Executes linear regression on simulated data and visualizes the results with color-coded residuals in a scatter plot.
- `PP_Dists.R`: Analyzes and visualizes the distribution of predator-prey mass ratios in an ecological dataset using `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.
- `PP_Regress.R`: Utilizes `ggplot2` and `dplyr` for data visualization and analysis. It reads ecological data, then creates a plot with linear regression lines to examine the relationship between predator and prey mass, distinguishing by the type of feeding interaction and predator life stage.
- `PP_Regress_loc.R`: Conducts linear regression analysis on predator-prey mass data, adjusting for unit differences and summarizing results.
- `preallocate.R`: Compares performance between preallocated and dynamically growing vectors in R, illustrating efficiency in memory management.
- `R_conditionals.R`: Demonstrates the use of conditional statements in R, including functions to check if a number is even, a power of two, or prime.
- `Ricker.R`: Implements the Ricker model to simulate population dynamics over generations and plots the result.
- `run_get_TreeHeight.sh`: A shell script that runs both R and Python scripts (`get_TreeHeight.R` and `get_TreeHeight.py`) to calculate tree heights.
- `sample.R`: Illustrates sampling techniques in R, including the use of loops and functions to compute sample means from a population.
- `TAutoCorr.R`: Analyzes temperature autocorrelation in Key West Annual Mean Temperature data using permutation testing for correlation coefficients.
- `TreeHeight.R`: Calculates tree heights using trigonometry from angle and distance data in a CSV file, and outputs the results to a new file.
- `try.R`: Demonstrates error handling in R with a function that calculates the mean of a sample, using `try` to catch exceptions for insufficient unique values.
- `Vectorize1.R`: Compares the performance of a double loop and vectorized function for summing all elements in a large matrix.
- `Vectorize2.R`: Implements the stochastic Ricker model with Gaussian fluctuations, illustrating the use of matrix operations for population dynamics simulation.
